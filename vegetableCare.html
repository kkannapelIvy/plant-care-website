<h3>Potatoes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The best time to plant potatoes is about 2 weeks after the last spring frost. THe soil the 
	potatoes are being planted in should not be very wet since very wet soil can rot the potato seeds. 
	They need around 6 hours of sunlight each day in a location that can drain water well. PLant the 
	potatoes in a trench and space the seeds 3 feet apart for optimal growing.</li>
	
</ul>
<h3>Carrots</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Depending on where the carrots are planted, check the soil for rocks. Rocks in the soil can limit 
	the growth of the carrots leading to smaller sizes when fully grown. Carrots should be planted either 
	4 weeks before the last spring frost or mid way through summer depending on the desired harvest date. 
	Carrots need a lot of sunlight throughout the day compared to other vegetables. They should be watered 
	frequently, but not enough where the soil is constantly wet.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Tomatoes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tomatoes should be planted after spring when it is getting warmer outside. Tomatoes need a good 
	amount of sunlight, about 8 - 10 hours of sunlight each day. Depending on the type of tomato that is being 
	grown, a support might be needed when the tomato is growing to support it's weight. Once planted, water the 
	tomatoes each day in the morning to help it grow during hot days.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Cucumbers</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Cucumbers should be planted 2 weeks after the last frost. They need soil that is fertile and drain water 
	well. Additionally cucumbers need to be planted in a location with a lot of sunlight throughout the day. 
	Depending on the cucumber, a trellis or similar support will be needed for the cucumber to support itself 
	on while growing.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Peppers</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Peppers should be planted after the last spring frost. They need to be planted in a location that gives the 
	peppers around 7 hours of sunlight each day, and peppers need to be spaced about 2 feet apart. 
	Peppers need some sort of support while it grows to help support itself when the peppers are fully grown. 
	Immediately after planting, water the peppers and then maintain consistent watering throughout the season.</li>
