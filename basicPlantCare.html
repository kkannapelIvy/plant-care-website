<h2>Basic Plant Care</h2>
<p>
	Whether it is flower care or vegetable care there are some common care tips that overlap. The table 
	below will show general care tips that apply to any flower or vegetable.
</p>

<table>
<caption>General Care</caption>
	<tr>
		<th>Flowers</th>
		<th>Vegetables</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Flowers generally need a location with a good amount of sunlight throughout the day. 
		The soil should drain water well so the flower won't get overwatered. Depending on the height of 
		the plant, a support might be needed for the flower's growth.</th>
		<th>Vegetables usually require more fequent watering compared to flowers. Just like flowers, vegetables 
		like to be in areas with more sunlight, instead of being in a dark location. Proper weeding of your 
		garden let your vegetables grow better due to no weeds fighting for nutrients in the garden. </th>
