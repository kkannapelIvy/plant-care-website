<h3>Rose</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Roses seem like a hard flower to care for, but that is far from the truth. Roses grow
	 best if they are planted at the start of spring in a location that will give them atleast 6 
	 hours of sunlight daily. Roses require watering when the top of the soil is dry, and avoid 
	 getting the leaves wet while watering.</li>
	
</ul>
<h3>Sunflower</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The best time to plant sunflowers is right after the spring frost has passed. Usually 
	this is around the month of April. Sunflowers require nutrient rich soil and around 7 hours of 
	sunlight per day. Depending on the type of sunflower, a support such as a fence might be 
	needed for the flower while it is growing.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Daisy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Daisies should be planted either in spring or early fall to provide optimal time to grow. 
	It should be planeted in soil that can drain water well, and be in a location where it can 
	get a good amount of sunlight.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Orchids</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Orchids like to be planted in areas that are warmer. Usually around 70 degrees Fahrenheit . 
	Orchids should be watered every 7 - 10 days. Depending on the type of Orchids, supports might 
	be needed for the plant to support their weight once grown.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Tulips</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tulips grown in the spring in locations with a lot of sun and soil that can drain well. 
	Water the tulips a lot right after planeting, but after that they don't need a lot of water, except 
	if there is a long time without rain.</li>
